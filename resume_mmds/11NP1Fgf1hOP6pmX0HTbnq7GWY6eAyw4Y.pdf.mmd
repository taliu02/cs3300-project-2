EXPERIENCE

OpenAI

July 2023-

Open Source Contributor SWE

Triton Project

- Implemented an LLVM backend interface using $\mathrm{C}++$ to facilitate the conversion between different LLVM dialects, bringing Triton to Apple Silicon Macs.

- Combined $\mathrm{C}++$ expertise with SPIRV-Cross to create an integrated cross-compiling toolchain, enabling efficient conversion from diverse LLVM-Dialects to Metal Shader Language

- Architected and developed a JIT compiler for GPU Metal kernels within Triton, harnessing the power of C++ and SPIRVCross, resulting in a remarkable $70 \%+$ speed increase in large matrix multiplication tasks on Apple Silicon Macs.

Microsoft- Guidance Project

May 2023 - July 2023

Open Source Contributor SWE

- Architected and implemented LLM support system with more efficient memory and disk-swapping for larger LLMS

- Harnessing the power of Token and Regex processors, led the orchestration of hundreds of LLMs to generate structured, schemaful data, boosting accuracy from $63.04 \%$ to $76.01 \%$.

- Transformed the token generation process by offloading operations to integrated REST API.
