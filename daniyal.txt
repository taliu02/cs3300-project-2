âš¡ About Me
I'm a computer scientist based in NYC with an avid interest in interdisciplinary learning. My mindset is perfectly embodied by this quote from Naval Ravikant:
"Learn to sell, learn to build - if you can do both, you will be unstoppable."
My specialties lie in developing desktop applications, fullstack websites, machine learning, and making it all visually stunning.
I am currently working on Resyzer - a SaaS windows desktop application which takes window management to the next level.
